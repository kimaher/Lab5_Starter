Check Your Understanding

1. I would not use a unit test for a messaging feature. Sending a message typically involves multiple components such as user input, network communication, database storage, and UI updates. This feature is far too complicated for unit tests, which are best fitted for isolated points of logic.
2. Yes, the “max message length” feature involves a clearly defined, isolated logic rule which can be easily tested independently without involving the entire messaging system.
